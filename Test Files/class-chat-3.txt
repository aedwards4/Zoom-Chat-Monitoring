09:45:41	 From Giovanni Garcia : it was just the one guy
09:46:01	 From Fatai Odunewu : yes, that's what I did
09:46:01	 From Mansoor Syed : yeah had to join from the browser, the window app wasn't working for some reason
09:46:08	 From Joshua Hutton : just out of curiosity, are all of the assignments going to be a similar length to this one?

09:47:20	 From Giovanni Garcia : true
09:47:36	 From Aman Luqman : on that note, does anyone have an easier way of making truth tables in LaTeX?
09:47:39	 From FENGLIAN LI : 8 hrs
09:47:50	 From Fatai Odunewu : took me 3hrs
09:47:59	 From Ameer Ali : 4-5 hours
09:48:02	 From Aman Luqman : each table took me like 30 minutes by hand 
09:48:09	 From Giovanni Garcia : Sorry, I just use OneNote
09:48:14	 From Michael Cardiff : Use  online table makers
09:48:17	 From Joshua Hutton : copy and paste helped me so much
09:48:17	 From Aman Luqman : smart
09:48:29	 From Khushboo B. Bhattu : I used Latex, it was fairly easy
09:48:44	 From Michael Cardiff : https://www.tablesgenerator.com/#
09:48:48	 From Mansoor Syed : I used google docs for the truth tables and it only took about 10-15 each table
09:48:59	 From Fatai Odunewu : Google docs is good as well 
09:49:02	 From Aman Luqman : @michael, you're a king, thank you
09:49:13	 From emberhomes : Agreed

10:04:39	 From Ameer Ali : if x is even then x^2 is even
10:04:39	 From marina pojani : f x isnt odd, then x^2 isnt odd
10:04:39	 From Min Kyoung Kang : if x if even then x squared is even
10:04:42	 From Giovanni Garcia : if x is not odd, then x^2 is not odd either
10:04:43	 From Mansoor Syed : if x not odd then x^2 not ood
10:04:50	 From Kevin Quach : if x is even. then x^2 is even

10:09:16	 From Zain Farhat : thanks that makes is better!
10:09:50	 From Alek Popovic : do we need to prove the other condition also?
10:11:18	 From Alek Popovic : right
10:11:23	 From Joshua Hutton : we already did
10:11:27	 From Alek Popovic : oh right 
10:11:41	 From Alek Popovic : my bad, thank you
10:12:07	 From marina pojani : yes
10:12:09	 From Michael Cardiff : Probably

10:12:52	 From Faith Busche : can you just prove that one number is NOT prime?
10:14:10	 From Faith Busche : ohhh my bad
10:14:35	 From Austin Roddy : wrote a program last week. I've found the first 1billion primes ðŸ˜‚
10:14:59	 From Zain Farhat : insane!
10:15:04	 From Michael Cardiff : 1 billion ~ infinity
10:15:15	 From Austin Roddy : only infinity left to go 
10:16:10	 From Ali H. : thats a prime
10:16:14	 From Ali H. : no

10:16:47	 From Sameeha Ahmed : yes
10:16:48	 From Giovanni Garcia : gotcha
10:17:05	 From Michael Cardiff : its unique
10:17:25	 From Joshua Hutton : but that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that m is prime? for example 5x3+1=16, and 16 isnâ€™t prime
10:18:13	 From Aman Luqman : m doesn't need to be prime, it's just the finite limit where primes "end"
10:18:39	 From Alisha Khan : Wouldnâ€™t you have to do 2*3*5+1 ?
10:18:43	 From Michael Cardiff : @joshua were gonna do cases

10:19:45	 From Aaron Paprocki : product of primes
10:20:35	 From Min Kyoung Kang : how could it not be on the list
10:20:51	 From Ali H. : pn+1
10:20:51	 From Aaron Paprocki : not finite
10:20:54	 From Anthony Banuelos : our first assumption is false
10:20:57	 From Alisha Khan : It is the product of previous primes
10:20:58	 From Fatai Odunewu : not finite
10:21:00	 From tabor : infinite
10:21:00	 From Aman Luqman : the list would just keep going
10:21:01	 From Joshua Prila : if new prime then there are infinitely many prime numbers

10:21:17	 From Alan Palayil : infinite
10:21:17	 From Andrea Ocampo : The list cant be finite
10:21:42	 From George Tapia : infinite 
10:21:42	 From marina pojani : infinte
10:21:42	 From Fatai Odunewu : so there are infinite primes
10:21:42	 From Mansoor Syed : therefore you just proved it by contradiction
10:22:17	 From Joshua Prila : why can't m just be a product of numbers that are not prime? (I understand why it cannot be a product of primes already in list)
10:23:00	 From Joshua Prila : wait nevermind I see
10:23:12	 From George Tapia : makes sense 
10:23:17	 From Abheek Mondal : so if you want to prove some thing with an infinite list, you would just take a finite version of it and do a proof by contradiction?
10:24:38	 From Abheek Mondal : oh no i have done induction before :(
10:25:26	 From Joshua Hutton : couldnâ€™t you just do it by saying that either a number is prime or it is composite, and so if there are infinite primes than there are infinite composite numbers?
10:26:15	 From Austin Roddy : can you prove that 25 is funnier than 24 
10:26:24	 From Michael Cardiff : We do not know that infinity plus infinity is infinity
10:26:31	 From Joshua Hutton : ok
10:28:08	 From Ayman Fahsi : if you put a function in the set would it still be called a set
10:28:27	 From Eddie Mei : can a set be infinite?
10:28:52	 From Zain Farhat : ellipse is the dots?
10:29:06	 From Aaron Paprocki : @zain yes

10:35:15	 From Michael Cardiff : takes a variable in a domain, evaluates to T or F
